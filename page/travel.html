				<p>But one thing I know for sure,</p>
				<p>This will change my life forever.</p>
				<break></break>
			
				<p>The night before I left Taiwan, I asked myself over and over again if I have to do this. Yeah, first time being a
				backpacker. First time traveling alone. First time speaking English. And first time doing everything on my own without
				any help from travel agencies.</p>

				<p>Sydney, the biggest city in Australia. Everything's so big and so complex. Especially the Central Station. When I
				arrived in there I was totally shocked. 21 platforms! Never seen so many in my life. And every street is extremely
				busy. Alright, I have to head for the hostel to put my luggage so that everything will be easier.</p>
				
				<p>The hostel located near the small beach which probably few backpackers knows about it -- Coogee Beach. I only
				checked one bus called "M50" and saved a screenshot in my phone, so I had to find the bus since I had no Internet.
				Well, or since I was too self-confident. So I spent 2 hours, dragging my 36kg luggage, running in circle and asking
				around Central station, but just couldn't find any signs showing M50. I did find one, but it was in the wrong
				direction. That luggage nearly killed me, and I'll swear I'll never do that again.</p>
				
				<p>When I finally arrived at Coogee Beach, it was already 2pm. I rang the hostel's doorbell, no one answered. I
				looked up to the sign near the door. "Office Hour: 9am-1pm, 5pm-10pm" Wait, what? They have lunch break? So I just
				dragged my luggage again back to the beach. I was so tired but I couldn't sleep. I felt so insecure about my stuff will
				get stolen anytime.</p>

				<p>我還是不知道，這班機會將我載往何處。</p>
				<p>我還是不知道，這公路會將我帶往何處。</p>
				<p>但我確實知道一件事</p>
				<p>這將永遠改變我的人生。</p>
				<break></break>
				
				<p>離開台灣的前一晚，我再三問我自己，是否一定要這樣做。是啊，第一次當背包客。第一次一個人旅行。第一次講英文。第一次不透過任何旅行社及仲介，
					所有事情自己一人包辦。</p>
